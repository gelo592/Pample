my goal throughout this project has been to try and get a proof of concept out to the world as quickly as possibly.
though i want to use the most apt tech at each level, over-engineering is a time suck and generally wasteful knowing the
future will probably hold many changes no matter how perfect something seems to be today.

first up, picking my database.
  my rough process:
    NoSQl or SQL? welp i don't really feel like learning or dealing with SQL syntax. plus, the rigid format of sql tables
    is daunting when my schema is changing every four minutes when i realize another column i forgot to include originally.
    okay, nosql it is then. Firebase? i have used this before so i could whip up an api pretty quickly. but did i like it?
    it was maybe a little too far from sql without great filtering. maybe i wasn't using it to the best of it's capabilities,
    but i felt like i was always pulling way more data than i needed and doing a lot of processing on the clientside (dragggg).
    databases i haven't used: mongodb vs rethinkdb
    honestly i pretty much just flipped a coin here. i was told that rethink was easy to get up and opperable quickly. beyond
    that i didn't need much convincing. i was bored of looking and the 'quickstart' was easy enough to follow.
voil√† my database was born.

since picking rethink i have gathered some pros and cons.
pros:
  the data console is handy. and the 'tool tips' that come with the suggested commands are super useful.
cons:
  some things are missing. i know rethink is meant to just be a blobby store, but since you can access 'tables'
  it follows that there would be some sorta of json schema checking included. which i sorely have been missing.
  it looked like there was some node module if you are using javascript. but i went with python so no such luck
  for me.




impactjs vs craftyjs vs atomicengine
there are about a billion options for game engines

impact is moolah, the tutorial did make it enticing though. just wich i could try before i buy
atomic is 'early access'
giving crafty a try

also looked at:
  gamemaker: looks like it isn't being maintained anymore (though i like the ide)
    the mac version is pretty poo though and the windows version on parallels is crashing (probs my fault for running on parallels)
    finally the first sample game i tried to make wouldn't compile
  unity:
    seems pretty solid might come back to this
  unreal:
    paper2d seems cool, but since this is really meant for 3d gonna pass
  construct2:
    got a working thing up very quickly. seems reasonable. only windows, but don't need licence for now (and they are relatively cheap)
    not a bad ide either
